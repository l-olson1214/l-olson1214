## I'm an iOS Engineer who loves baking, powerlifting, all things arts and crafts, dog training, and learning new things

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an app for the Maker's Market that I host at WillowTree!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about code architecture and design.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything! I love new projects!
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with ensuring I'm using best practices - if you see something wrong or that could be better, let me know!
- 💬 Ask me about accessibility! 
- 😄 Pronouns: They/them
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have two dogs - one named Reese (if we ever chat virtually, she'll probably make an appearance), and a corgi puppy named Bort
